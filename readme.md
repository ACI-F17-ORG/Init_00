#### 1. Github
Head over to [github](https://github.com/) and create a free account. You may want to additionally install their applications [osx](http://mac.github.com) or [windows](http://windows.github.com). For [linux](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-linux) it's command line. On any platform, say yes if it asks about command line git or tools. If you want a student micro plan for private repositories, then ask [github edu](https://github.com/edu).

#### 2. Vimeo
Now to [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) and create a free account. Groups you may want to join/follow: [OF](https://vimeo.com/groups/openframeworks), [eyeo](https://vimeo.com/eyeofestival), [kinect](https://vimeo.com/groups/kinect), [resonate](https://vimeo.com/resonateio)

#### 3. Screen recording 
> __OSX__ 
>> Do nothing, quicktime has you covered. 

>> [OBS](https://obsproject.com)

> __Windows (free)__ 
>> [OBS](https://obsproject.com)

>> possible option: [shadow play](http://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/shadowplay)

> __Windows (pay)__
>> [fraps](http://www.fraps.com)

> __Linux__
>> [OBS](https://obsproject.com)
 
>> [Record My Desktop](http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php)

#### 4. Development Environment
On the [openFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) page will be instructions for how to download what you need for any platform. 

__Windows__ 
> Don't try to squeeze by with Visual Studio 2017. Unless you know what you're doing, just go get VS 2015. 


#### 5. openFrameworks (OF)
Download and install [OF](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) for your platform and environment; or, if you know what you're doing [OF git](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks).

#### 6. Run, Capture, Upload
The [OF](http://www.openframeworks.cc/download/) site has help per platform per development environment on how to run a project. If you're using the github repository, then follow the additional directions about how to use get and use the project generator on the OF github page.

Run any project, capture a few seconds of it as proof, and upload that video to your vimeo account. I suggest uploading a standard definition (SD) instead of high definition (HD). We don't need audio on this upload. The free Vimeo account limits your HD uploads, so save them for videos that need it. Vimeo has compression guidelines and tutorials for [uploading](https://vimeo.com/help/compression). Youtube doesn't care so much what you upload.

#### 7. Fork & Pull
Fork the Init_00 repository into your account. You may need merge from course repo first, then sync. Enter yourself alphabetically into the links.md file with your name and vimeo link. Create a pull request of the file for your changes to be integrated. There will be merge conflicts that you'll need to resolve. 

#### 8. Read
_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 1, optional

_Programming Interactivity_, Chapter 2, look through and try to get a feel for what we'll be dealing with when working with code. It's ok to not totally understand it.
